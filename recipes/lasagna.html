    <h2>How to make it</h2>
    <p>Spoon meat sauce on the bottom of a lightly greased casserole dish. Add 4 boiled lasagna noodles (or use no-boil or fresh noodles). Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture on top. Add 1.5 cups of meat sauce.

    Repeat the same layers two more times.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>Cheese Filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>3/4 cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Meat Sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>3/4 lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>3/4 lb. ground Italian sausage</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>40 oz. marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce (optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Lasagna</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles, plus extra in case of breakage</li>
            <li>2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Combine the cheese filling ingredients </strong>in a 
                medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li><strong>Heat olive oil </strong>over medium heat and add 
                the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. 
                (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice 
                offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
            <li><strong>Add the ground beef and sausage </strong>and increase 
                heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that 
                it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until 
                cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess 
                grease.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the chicken broth </strong>and use a silicone 
                spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the 
                marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire 
                sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially
                 and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta 
                 noodles.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>
            <li><strong>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water </strong>
                 for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the
                  noodles to al dente according to package instructions. 
                  (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir 
                  with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles 
                  from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles 
                  are completely cool. </li>
            <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper 
                while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
            <li><strong>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce </strong>on the 
                bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna 
                noodles, overlapping them if needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture </strong>over 
                the noodles, followed by about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese 
                mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the 
                ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese. </strong></li>
            <li><strong>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray </strong>and 
                place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent 
                the cheese from sticking to it.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake for 35 minutes. </strong>Remove cover and bake 
                for 10 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. Let it sit for 
                15 minutes prior to serving to allow the layers to set. 
                Serve with garlic bread with cheese.</li>
            <li><strong>Enjoy</strong></li>
