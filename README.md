# odin-recipes
<!-- This is the fisrt project for the odin project. I am going to create a website describing my favorite meal to make. I will teach you how to make it and what ingredients you will need to accomplish the best chicken alfrado that you will taste. If you follow the instructions to a "T" I garantee that you will make a better chicken alfrado than you can get at olive garden. I will also be demonstrating how to create a html file, use paragraphs, use lists, images, links and more. Thank you for opening my project and I hope you use my website as an example to help make your own website. If this helped you please reach out and show me what you created. I would love to see your work and learn from your projects as well. -->
